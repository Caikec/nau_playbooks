# Mongo docker deploy

Deploy Mongo DB service using a docker compose file.

This role deploys a Mongo DB service using `host` network.
Alternatively it would require that all the other mongo nodes has `extra_hosts` configuration
and the clients also has an `extra_hosts` to know the real IP address of each Mongo node.

## Add Members to a Replica Set
https://www.mongodb.com/docs/v3.6/tutorial/expand-replica-set/

Deploy this role to new server.

Connect to the replica setâ€™s primary. Run this to know which is the primary.
```
db.hello()
```

Add this new mongo to the replica set.
```
rs.add( { host: "mongodb3.example.net:27017", priority: 0, votes: 0 } )
```

Ensure it reaches SECONDARY state.
```
rs.status()
```

Deploy the new node to clients, like open edx.

Update the new node:
```
var cfg = rs.conf();
cfg.members[4].priority = 1
cfg.members[4].votes = 1
rs.reconfig(cfg)
```
